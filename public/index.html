          <div><h3>hi and also hello.</h3>
            <p>i am jay, the webmaster around these parts. 
            i am a huge "old internet" enthusiast, despite technically being too young to have really experienced the joys of it in full.
            so can we call this site an attempt to recapture my lost childhood? maybe so. 
            as you can likely tell, this website is very much a work-in-progress, but currently i intend to use it as a digital journal + a shrine for my interests. 
            </p>
            <p>
            even if it never ends up fully complete, i'm really enjoying having this place as a pet project. 
            my computer science degree really did a number on me, so rediscovering my own love of messing around with simple html/css/javascript has been a joy. 
            i hope you enjoy your time here too!

          <p>
            some things about this site to take note of:
            <ul>
              <li>this site is tested exclusively on mozilla firefox! it should work on other browsers, but if anything breaks or shows up weird, feel free to download + use firefox instead :^&#41;</li>
              <li>along similar lines, this site should be responsive + usable on mobile</li>
              <li>while i don't plan on hosting explicit material here, i am an adult and the content on this site is intended for an adult audience.</li>
              <li>where possible, graphics will link to the source i got them from, and all material will be credited on the <a href="https://midsummerjay.neocities.org/credits.html">credits</a> page.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
