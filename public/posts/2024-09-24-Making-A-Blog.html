          <h1>making a blog (09/24/2024)</h1>
          <p>wow this is so fun and yet also a huge pain in the ass.</p>
          <p>i've built this blog by downloading <a href="https://zonelets.net/">the zonelets code</a> and then fucking with it a ton. 
            am i done yet? no, but i would like to be for today, so i'm calling it quits here.</p>
            <p>some major issues i've decided are going to stick around for now:
                <ul>
                    <li>i don't actually know how all the zonelets code works. i've just tweaked whatever came to mind and haven't even looked at the rest of it. haha</li>
                    <li>all my sidebar images are broken because i didn't want to bother figuring out how to dynamically access directories through javascript. because i'm LAZY</li>
                    <li>i have literally zero plans for this blog. when will i post? how often? with what content? your guess is as good as mine. </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>okay now that this is all out of the way, i'm going to go watch amongus vods. thanks for reading :^&#41;</p>
