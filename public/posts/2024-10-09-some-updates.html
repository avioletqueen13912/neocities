          <h1>some updates (10/09/2024)</h1>
          <p>wow thinking of a blog title is harder than i thought it would be. like ah... so THIS is why i never titled my tumblr posts.</p>
          <p>life has been a little crazy tbh. buuut i'm trying to focus on the present and take it one day at a time.</p>
          <p>i've been getting really into shinee's key lately, which is possibly the least expected "next step" in my kpop journey. 
            he's just a funny guy!! but i've decided that if i'm going to keep watching korean media and listening to people speaking the language, i might as well try to learn it.
            coursera "learn korean" course, here i come.</p>
          <p>i haven't done much updating of my blog lately, but i'd like to work on it more soon. maybe when my adderall comes in, haha. god.
            shoutout to the american healthcare system and big pharma, am i right?!?
          </p>
          <p>but yes, i'd like to work on my blog more. if only to fill out my bio + start making shrines for the stuff i enjoy. like yeah, i think i DO need a spot on the internet to talk about ace attorney or kpop or fe3h endlessly. twitter is not enough.</p>
          <p>okay i think that's it. blog post 2 done. hope u liked it. leave a comment if you did!!! hopefully.</p>
