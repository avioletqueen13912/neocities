          <h1>a new month (02/02/2025)</h1>
          <p>i think it's really funny to have my previous blog post say "a possible return" and then to not post for nearly a year. in fact i think it might even be chic.
            the last 8 months have been one doozy after another, and i'm certainly not out of the hole yet. but i thought about this website with a pang of nostalgia the other day,
            then felt silly for being nostalgic, because it's not like i can't just log back in and mess around again. so here i am.
          </p>
          <p>
            idk how much i'll use this blog, or what i'll use it for. i'm a consistent journaler now, which is fun and exciting and very very good for me, but it also means that i don't 
            necesarily need a blog to get my thoughts in order or to vent to an imaginary audience. buuuuuut not everything in my life needs a defined use case. i can probably post here whenever
            i feel like it. vibes-based behaviors... 
          </p>

            updates about me!! i have been playing games and watching movies. toad and i are watching almost every m night shyamalan movie in order of release (because media club plus, a podcast
            run by the wonderful friends at the table crew, has been doing the same). it's really fascinating to develop your taste by watching a really good movie followed by a bunch of movies that 
            vary in quality but certainly never live up to the promise of that first one. i'm coming out of this experience feeling very pretentious about my funny letterboxd and also being a staunch
            defender of lady in the water. the rogue scrunt and the madam narf can be sooo important.  
          </p>
          <p>
            okay that's all for today because i do want to tidy up some other parts of this site. THANKS FOR TUNING IN.
          </p>
