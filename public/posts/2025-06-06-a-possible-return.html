          <h1>a possible return (06/06/2025)</h1>
          <p>it's been a while since i was active here. my neocities consumed me last fall, but then things fell off as life shifted. but it's really cool that i did this. and it's really cool that it's always going to be here for me to return to when i want.</p>
          <p>i'm going through some pretty intense grief rn, and i'm on the search for quiet nice things. i think picking away at this website falls under that umbrella. though i think i petered out last time because i ran out of ideas of things to do. everything i add just feels like it makes the place more chaotic and disorganized... idk, maybe that's because my life is chaotic and disorganized. idk idk. maybe that's okay though.</p>
          <p>i started out this year really strong. i was reading, writing, studying korean, and working out every day. the grief has definitely stopped me in my tracks, but i'm hopeful to start those hobbies up again soon. it would be good for me. i'm fully aware of that.</p>
          <p>my partner toad and i bought a condo. that's pretty cool. we're planning on moving this weekend. it's so overwhelming to deal with the quantity of stuff we have, but hopefully it goes ok.</p>
          <p>whether i return here consistently or sporadically, i think that's okay. it's nice to have a place where i <i>can</i> be viewed, but i don't necessarily know that it's always going to be happening - in stark contrast to the constant numbers game of social media. </p>
          <p>anyway. i think that's it for today. if you're reading this, thanks for tuning in. that's pretty cool of you.</p>
